# fasta_generator

This python script will generate a random FastA sequence and a mutated version of the same sequence. The function takes as
arguments the desired length of each chromosome and the number of chromosomes required, and also the frequency of mutations
in the mutated sequence. 

The sequences this script generates are output in standard fasta format, which allows them to be read and parsed by all 
genome sequencing tools. This is therefore a good starting point to make synthetic genome sequence data, to test your 
genome analysis tools on.
